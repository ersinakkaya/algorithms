# Coin

Imagine you landed a new job as a cashier...
Your quirky boss found out that you're a programmer and has a weird request about something they've been wondering for a long time.

Write a function that, given:

an amount of money
an array of coin denominations
computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

Example: for amount=44 (44¢) and denominations=[1,2,3][1,2,3] (11¢, 22¢ and 33¢), your program would output 44—the number of ways to make 44¢ with those denominations:

1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
1¢, 1¢, 2¢
1¢, 3¢
2¢, 2¢
