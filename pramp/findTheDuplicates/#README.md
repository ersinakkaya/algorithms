#Find the Duplicates
Given two arrays of US social security numbers: Arr1 and Arr2 of lengths n and m respectively, how can you most efficiently compute an array of all persons included on both arrays?

Solve and analyze the complexity for 2 cases:
1. m ≈ n - lengths are approximately the same
2. m ≫ n - one is much longer than the other
