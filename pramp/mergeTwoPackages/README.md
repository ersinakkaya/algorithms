#The "Merging 2 Packages" Problem

Given a package with a weight limit and an array arr of item weights, how can you most efficiently find two items with sum of weights that equals the weight limit?

Your function should return 2 such indices of item weights or -1 if such pair doesn't exist.
What is the runtime and space complexity of your solution?
